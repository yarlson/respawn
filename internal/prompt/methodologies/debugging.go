## The Iron Law

NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST

If you haven't investigated, you cannot propose fixes.

## Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

BEFORE attempting ANY fix:

1. **Read Error Messages Carefully**
   - Don't skip past errors or warnings
   - Read stack traces completely
   - Note line numbers, file paths, error codes

2. **Reproduce Consistently**
   - Can you trigger it reliably?
   - What are the exact steps?

3. **Check Recent Changes**
   - What changed that could cause this?
   - Git diff, recent commits

4. **Trace Data Flow**
   - Where does bad value originate?
   - What called this with bad value?
   - Keep tracing up until you find the source
   - Fix at source, not at symptom

## Phase 2: Hypothesis and Testing

1. **Form Single Hypothesis**
   - State clearly: "I think X is the root cause because Y"
   - Be specific, not vague

2. **Test Minimally**
   - Make the SMALLEST possible change to test hypothesis
   - One variable at a time
   - Don't fix multiple things at once

3. **Verify Before Continuing**
   - Did it work? Yes → implement fix
   - Didn't work? Form NEW hypothesis
   - DON'T add more fixes on top

## Red Flags - STOP and Return to Phase 1

- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- "Add multiple changes, run tests"
- "It's probably X, let me fix that"
- Proposing solutions before tracing data flow

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Key Activities | Success Criteria |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **1. Root Cause** | Read errors, reproduce, check changes | Understand WHAT and WHY |
| **2. Hypothesis** | Form theory, test minimally | Confirmed or new hypothesis |`

## The Iron Law

NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST

If you haven't completed Phase 1, you cannot propose fixes.

## Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

BEFORE attempting ANY fix:

1. **Read Error Messages Carefully**
   - Don't skip past errors or warnings
   - Read stack traces completely
   - Note line numbers, file paths, error codes

2. **Reproduce Consistently**
   - Can you trigger it reliably?
   - What are the exact steps?
   - If not reproducible → gather more data, don't guess

3. **Check Recent Changes**
   - What changed that could cause this?
   - Git diff, recent commits
   - Environmental differences

4. **Gather Evidence in Multi-Component Systems**

   WHEN system has multiple components:
   - Log what data enters each component
   - Log what data exits each component
   - Verify environment/config propagation
   - Run once to gather evidence showing WHERE it breaks
   - THEN analyze evidence to identify failing component

5. **Trace Data Flow**
   - Where does bad value originate?
   - What called this with bad value?
   - Keep tracing up until you find the source
   - Fix at source, not at symptom

## Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

1. **Find Working Examples**
   - Locate similar working code in same codebase
   - What works that's similar to what's broken?

2. **Compare Against References**
   - If implementing pattern, read reference implementation COMPLETELY
   - Don't skim - read every line

3. **Identify Differences**
   - What's different between working and broken?
   - List every difference, however small

## Phase 3: Hypothesis and Testing

1. **Form Single Hypothesis**
   - State clearly: "I think X is the root cause because Y"
   - Be specific, not vague

2. **Test Minimally**
   - Make the SMALLEST possible change to test hypothesis
   - One variable at a time
   - Don't fix multiple things at once

3. **Verify Before Continuing**
   - Did it work? Yes → Phase 4
   - Didn't work? Form NEW hypothesis
   - DON'T add more fixes on top

## Phase 4: Implementation

1. **Create Failing Test Case**
   - Simplest possible reproduction
   - MUST have before fixing

2. **Implement Single Fix**
   - Address the root cause identified
   - ONE change at a time
   - No "while I'm here" improvements

3. **Verify Fix**
   - Test passes now?
   - No other tests broken?

## CRITICAL: Architectural Check

**If this is rotation 2 or 3, previous approaches failed completely.**

STOP and question fundamentals:
- Is this pattern fundamentally sound?
- Are we fighting the wrong architecture?
- Should we try a completely different approach?

Pattern indicating architectural problem:
- Each fix reveals new problem in different place
- Fixes require "massive refactoring" to implement
- Each fix creates new symptoms elsewhere

**Consider: Is the current approach correct, or should we rethink it entirely?**

## Red Flags - STOP and Return to Phase 1

- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- "It's probably X, let me fix that"
- Proposing solutions before tracing data flow
- "One more fix attempt" after multiple failures

|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **1. Root Cause** | Read errors, reproduce, check changes, gather evidence | Understand WHAT and WHY |
| **2. Pattern** | Find working examples, compare | Identify differences |
| **3. Hypothesis** | Form theory, test minimally | Confirmed or new hypothesis |
| **4. Implementation** | Create test, fix, verify | Bug resolved, tests pass |`
